      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I went to school for Industrial Engineering and worked in a soup plant for a few years before moving to Portland. Since then I worked for REI in the stores and then as a Merchandising Data Specialist at the HQ in Kent WA. I moved back to Portland and I'm learning to code, because I hear if I somehow become a coder with two years of experience, I'll be able to get a job again.</p>
      <p>I run, climb, and do all the normal NW outdoor activities, and take my dog along for most of them.</p>

      <ul>Here are a few skills that I have listed on my resume:
        <li>Excel</li>
        <li>SAP</li>
        <li>6 sigma Greenbelt</li>
      </ul> 

      <ol>Activities in order of preference
        <li>running</li>
        <li>coding</li>
        <li>job search activites</li>
      </ol>
